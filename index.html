			<span class="sectLine"></span>
			<br>
			<p>	I grew up and graduated high school from a small town in Wisconsin called Rice Lake.  In high school I was always active,
				participating in the Football, Swimming, and Track teams.  Once I graduated high school, I attended <b>University of Wisconsin - 
				Eau Claire</b> to earn my major in <b>Information Systems</b> with an emphasis in Business Analysis.  </p>
			<br>
			<p>	While attending school at Eau Claire, I took part in a research project and entrepreneurial contest in which 2 friends and 
				myself worked on creating an application to help people with smart phones better share their photos.  Although the project 
				was never completed, this experience opened my eyes to designing and creating software. </p>
			<br>
			<p> When I graduated school I immediately moved to Appleton, Wisconsin, to work for <b>Bemis Company</b>.  My time at Bemis was amazing.  I
				had a lot of opportunities for many different positions, due to their new grad rotational program.  I held the following positions:
				<ul id="jobs">
					<li> IT Customer Service </li>
					<li> K2 Business Analyst </li>
					<li> Database Administrator </li>
					<li> Operations Support Business Analyst </li>
				</ul>
			<br>
			<p>	Once the rotational program was completed I stayed with the position of <b>Operations Support Business Analyst</b>.  In this role
				I communicated with business users when they had trouble with our in-house application for buyers to purchase new material
				and view open orders.  During my time in this role I also acted as project manager for the upgrade of a planning software
				used by customer service representatives. </p>

					<h3>Python 2D Scroller</h3>
					<p>This is a 2D side scroller game that has kept me very busy!  I am still in the stages of creating the physics and general engine of the game.  I am using the following libraries:</p>
					<br>
					<ul class="resList">
						<li>pyGame - A very popular and widely used library that helps create computer graphics and sounds in the Python language</li>
						<li>pyTMX - A library that helps sort through tilesets to create maps for a game</li>
						<li>pyScroll - This library lets you scroll through maps that do not fit on a single screen</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p>I am not nearly completed with this game and am looking forward to continuing its development.  At its current stage, the game drops you into a small map, where you can control your character with the arrow keys.  The character is generated from a spritesheet that makes the walking animation.  Not only can you walk, but your character also has a gun that he can shoot.  Beware of the one enemy on the map though, make sure to take him out before he hits you!</p>
					<br>
					<p> Enhancements in the near future include: </p>
					<br>
					<ul class="resList">
						<li>Health system</li>
						<li>Ammo system</li>
						<li>Intelligent AI that fights back</li>
						<li>Different weapons</li>
						<li>Level creation</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Android Game</h3>
					<p>This project has been an absolute blast to work on.  I have always been curious how mobile games are made, so I figured to best way to find out was to make one!  This game is still in its infancy stages but I am happy with what I have accomplished and learned so far. </p>
					<br>
					<p>Once the game loads you find a makeshift controllor at the bottom of your phone.  The left rectangle is for moving your ball, and the right is for aiming.  As you move your finger in the aiming control box, you will notice that a crosshair moves in a perfect circle around your ball.  You can also fire out a projectile once you have set your sights.  Obviously the game has no objective yet, but I have plans to create a full game from this concept!</p>
					<br>
					<p> Enhancements in the near future include: </p>
					<br>
					<ul class="resList">
						<li>Smoother vertical scrolling</li>
						<li>Border detection</li>
						<li>Enhanced graphics (Everything is placeholder at the moment)</li>
						<li>Creating the game objective (It's a secret for now!)</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p>This is game was created with the libGDX library - a popular library for creating games in Java</p>

					<h3>News Website Using PHP</h3>
					<p>At the moment, this project is admittedly a mess!  The idea of this website is for users to read up to date articles and for authors to easily be able to log on and create content.  This experience has been great as it has taught me a lot about PHP and everything that is possible with it.  The main features currently include:</p>
					<br>
					<ul class="resList">
						<li>Dynamic page creation - The pages are not static, they are generated by pulling the most up to date articles</li>
						<li>A login system - The login system checks the username and password with an SQL database</li>
						<li>A homemade CMS (Content Management System) - This allows authors to login with a username and password, and write an article which is then stored in a database</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p> Unfortunately, the site is currently under construction, so showing all the featues is a bit difficult.  I plan to keep you up to date with its progress, and you can view the code on my gitHub page!</p>
					<br>
					<p> Enhancements in the near future include: </p>
					<br>
					<ul class="resList">
						<li>Redesigning the layout</li>
						<li>More secure login system</li>
					</ul>
